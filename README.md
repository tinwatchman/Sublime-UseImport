# UseImport Plugin for Sublime Text

A package for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) that works with the [`use-import`](https://github.com/tinwatchman/use-import) and [`use-automapper`](https://github.com/tinwatchman/use-automapper) modules to make Node.js projects easier to organize and maintain.

Still in development. Details soon.
